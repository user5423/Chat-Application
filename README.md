# Chat Application

As part of my Networks Coursework assignment I built a terminal MultiClient-Server
Terminal Chat Application. Additionally, there is a piece of written work that contains answers to the assignment relating to CSMA/CA

## Usage

Start by setting up the server using

`python3 server.py PORT`

And then clients can connect using

`python3 client.py USERNAME HOST PORT`


## NOTES

This is supported on Windows and not for Linux as the client program seemed to face some issues with exiting
the interface, and other minor stability issues that I was unable to reproduce
